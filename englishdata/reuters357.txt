FEBRUARY U.S. PURCHASING MANAGER INDEX FALLS
The U.S. economy continued to expand in February, but at a slower pace than in January which saw a spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) said in a report.     The Association's composite survey index declined to 51.9 pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator was over 50 pct.     A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy.     The report, based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies, also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February.     However, production remained vigorous as more than three times as many members reported it better rather than worse.     Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members reported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel <X> gradually resumed production.     An equal number of members reported inventories were higher and lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984.     For a sixth month, more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.     Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc <PBI> said "the economy continued to expand in February, but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for a respectable first quarter."     The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.
