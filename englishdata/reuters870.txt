DENG SAYS CHINA'S TROUBLES OVER
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping told visiting U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz China's recent troubles were over.     The two discussed Washington's scandal over U.S. Arms sales to Iran and China's political situation after the fall of Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang.     Deng said: "I know the President has had some difficulties but I think now it doesn't matter. When one is running a government one has to deal with troubles."     "As for the troubles we recently encountered, they are over," Deng added.
