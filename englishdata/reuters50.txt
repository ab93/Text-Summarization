REPUBLICANS EYE BIGGER U.S. CONSERVATION RESERVE
A group of Republican governors and members of Congress said they intended to explore expanding the conservation reserve program by up to 20 mln acres.     Under current law, between 40 and 45 mln acres of erodible land must be enrolled in the program by the end of fiscal 1990.     The Republican Task Force on Farm and Rural America, headed by Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (Kan.), said they would consider drafting legislation to increase the reserve by between 15 and 20 mln acres.     Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) told Reuters he would offer a bill to expand the reserve to 67 mln acres.
