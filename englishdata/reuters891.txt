EGYPT ALLOWS FUGITIVE LIBYANS STAY
Egypt allowed five fugitive Libyan soldiers who landed in a military plane in the far south of the country last night to stay and flew them to Cairo, official sources said.     It appeared the government had agreed to demands by the five -- two officers and three privates -- for political asylum but there was no immediate announcement.     Official sources said Egyptian servicemen flew the Libyans north from Abu Simbel in their C-130 transport plane. The status of the sixth Libyan on board, the pilot, was not immediately known.
