U.S. ACTS TO PROTECT KAISER STEEL RETIREES
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, a federal agency, said it took action to protect pensions of employees and retirees of Kaiser Steel Corp, which filed for bankruptcy reorganization last month.     The agency said it entered into an agreement to terminate the Kaiser plan, and was appointed its trustee.     It said that Kaiser retirees will receive their March pension checks without interruption and thereafter at levels guaranteed by law.
