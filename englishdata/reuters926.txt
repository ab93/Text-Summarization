TAIWAN BANKS ASKED TO TAKE PART IN INDONESIA LOAN
Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd of Hong Kong has approached Taiwan banks to take part in a syndicated loan of 300 mln U.S. Dlrs to finance a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Indonesia, local banking sources said.     The project calls for construction of a 400 mln U.S. Dlr facility which could produce two mln tonnes of LNG for supply by Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp .     This was the first time Taiwanese banks, including the Bank of Taiwan and Bank of Communications, were invited to form a syndicated loan, they added.     Pertamina has initialled a 20-year contract with Chinese Petroleum Corp <CPC> for the supply of 1.5 mln tonnes of LNG for Taiwan starting October 1989, a CPC official said.     CPC is building an LNG receiving terminal in southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung at a cost of 820 mln U.S. Dlrs. The terminal will be completed in mid-1989.     A Taiwanese banker said"It will be a good idea for our banks to take part in the loan if we want to start in the international lending market."
