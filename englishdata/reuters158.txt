ARMY TO RENEGOTIATE ITT <ITT> RADIO CONTRACT
The Army said it will renegotiate a 400 mln dlr contract with ITT Corp for jam-proof field radios after recent tests indicated the radios will work properly.     Full production of 44,600 of the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) sets has been delayed since the contract was let in 1983. The radios did not meet specifications of operating for 1,250 hours before failing.     The Army said recent tests have indicated better reliability and that the contract will be renegotiated.
