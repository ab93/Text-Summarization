EC MINISTERS POSTPONE TALKS ON SAVING DAIRY PACT
European Community (EC) farm ministers early today abandoned talks aimed at saving an agreement on cutting excessive milk production after making no progress in over 12 hours of negotiations.     The ministers will resume talks at 10.00 local time in a bid to clear the way for a full-scale review of proposed reforms for other surplus sectors.     Diplomats said member states were unable to settle differences over new rules limiting farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted butter at high guaranteed prices into EC cold stores. West Germany and Ireland are opposed to the steps.
