REAGAN'S CIA MAN WITHDRAWS, VICTIM OF IRAN SCANDAL
President Reagan's nominee as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Robert Gates, withdrew his name from consideration by the Senate in the face of a long battle for confirmation.     His withdrawal was announced at a White House news conference by Reagan's new Chief-of-Staff, Howard Baker, who said the President had accepted it with great regret.     Gates, now deputy head of the CIA, had been questioned about CIA involvement in the Iran-contra scandal and leading senators had warned his nomination was in trouble. Baker said Gates would remain as deputy director of the spy agency.
