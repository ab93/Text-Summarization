JAPANESE BANKS PLAN JOINT FIRM TO AVOID DEBT RISK
Japan's major commercial banks plan to set up a joint company to which they will transfer assets acquired by lending to developing countries to build up a reserve against possible bad loans, a senior official of a major bank told Reuters.     He said about 10 banks are likely to finish details of the project in a few weeks. The intent is to avoid risk arising from unrecoverable debt owed by Third World countries, he said.
