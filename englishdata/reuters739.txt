FUNARO REJECTS UK SUGGESTION OF IMF BRAZIL PLAN
Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro flatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek International Monetary Fund help in order to facilitate debt negotiations with commercial creditor banks.     Talking to reporters, Funaro said this attitude would not help resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspended indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external debt on February 20.     Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of European capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debt moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve capital flows between developed countries and third world debtor nations.    Talking before his departure for Paris, he said there could be no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity plan after a similar package four years ago "put Brazil in a very big recession."     "We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more and import less. We are not going to go the IMF," he said.     Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following his talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, saying the U.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as a problem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks.     Britain also believed an IMF program would help along negotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks, the statement, which banking sources interpreted as an outright rebuttal of all Brazilian demands, said.     "That was not my impression of the meeting," Funaro said; "But if the (British) answer is more or less like this, then that means nothing is helping to find a solution."     Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week and in Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support to unblock lending from official credit agencies, rather than to deal with Brazils ties with commercial banks.     "Since 1982, all official agencies have been closed to my country," he said.     He said Lawson had made no commitments to support Brazil's efforts. Lawson would officially state his position when the two meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington, Funaro said.     Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil's debt problem to be resolved, Funaro said Brazil had not come to Europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis.     "We didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme," he said, "We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let's see what happens."     Neither did Brazil plan a major overhaul of current domestic economic policies, which Funaro said would likely lead to a five pct economic growth this year.     "Over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs and received 11 billion ... This is a very big effort," he said. "What we have to offer is our cooperation."
