UAW WANTS TO REVIVE AMERICAN MOTORS <AMO> TALKS
The United Auto Workers said it is willing to enter renewed negotiations to end the impasse between American Motors Corp and two UAW locals in Wisconsin.     American Motors earlier said it broke off talks with the UAW on a new labor contract for its plant at Kenosha, Wis. The company's move came after its latest contract offer was rejected by union negotiators.     UAW vice president Marc Stepp said he "strongly recommends" new meetings be scheduled "at the earliest possible time." Stepp heads the UAW's American Motors department.
