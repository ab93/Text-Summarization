IEL SETS 100 MLN DLR NOTE/COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUE
Australian investment group <Industrial Equity Ltd> (IEL) said it will raise 100 mln U.S. Dlrs by the issue of medium term notes and commercial paper in the U.S. Domestic market.     IEL has mandated <Merrill Lynch Capital Markets> to arrange a letter of credit (LOC) facility in support of the notes and commercial paper, making this the first facility of its kind, the company said in a statement.     The notes will be issued by its <IEL Finance Ltd> unit.     Merrill Lynch will be the note and paper dealer and <Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co Ltd> will provide the LOC.     The term of the LOC is five years with an evergreen feature which provides for annual reinstatement of the five-year term at the support banks' option, IEL said.     The LOC will be underwritten by a group of banks which will receive a facility fee of 20 basis points plus a utilisation fee of 25 basis points, it added.
