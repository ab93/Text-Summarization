OERLIKON UNIT REJECTS DUTCH PATENT CHARGES
Oerlikon-Buehrle Holding AG <OEBZ.Z> unit <Contraves AG> unequivocally rejects charges by NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS> subsidiary <Hollandse Signaalapparaten BV> that it violated patent rights in a radar system developed by the latter, a Contraves official said.     Max Baumann, a member of the Contraves board, told Reuters his company was awaiting judgement in the case before a Zurich court "quite calmly," but he declined to discuss it in detail.     Signaal claims Contraves included the Dutch firm's patented X/KA double-frequency radar in an anti-aircraft system. Baumann said he expected judgement to take several months at least.
