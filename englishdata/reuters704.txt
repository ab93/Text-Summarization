CCR Video Corp said it is now current in its filing requirements with both the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ, and meets the trading system's net worth requirements.     The company reported a first quarter, ended November 30, profit of 156,726 dlrs compared to a year earlier loss of 776,000 dlrs.     CCR also said its previously reported refinanceing in December resulted in an extraordinary gain of 456,004 dlrs, leaving the company with a net worth of 633,581 dlrs at the end of December.     At the end of November, a spokesman noted, CCR did not meet NASDAQ's requirement of a net worth of 100,000 dlrs and has been trading on an exception to those rules.
