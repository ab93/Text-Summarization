FLUOR CORP <FLR> DEBT DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S
Moody's Investors Service Inc said it lowered the ratings on about 390 mln dlrs of Fluor Corp's long-term debt and commercial paper.     Moody's said the action, which completes a review begun February 6, reflects expectations that pressure on earnings and cash flow are likely to continue for some time.     This will result in stress on debt-protection measures, although the firm's continuing core businesses have strong positions within their industries. Ratings cut include those on senior notes, Eurobonds and pollution control bonds to BA-2 from BAA-3 and commercial paper to not-prime from prime-3.
