POLISH BANKER PLEASED WITH WORLD BANK, IMF TALKS
Poland's talks in Washington with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the country's 33.5 billion dlr foreign debt were concrete, open and frank, a senior Polish banker was quoted as saying.     Wladyslaw Baka, head of Poland's National Bank, told the official news agency PAP yesterday the talks were a step towards possible fresh credits or easier terms.     "Much attention was given to the Polish delegation and the talks at both institutions involved displayed a lot of understanding for Poland's difficult economic position," PAP quoted Baka as saying.     Baka said he stressed Poland would meet its financial obligations to the U.S., "but not in a short time, and not without major changes in the Polish economy as well as a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners."     Since Poland rejoined the IMF last June, after a 36-year absence, IMF and World Bank teams have visited Warsaw on fact-finding missions on at least three occasions. A major report is expected to be issued in Washington soon.     Poland has said it will not be able to meet interest repayments and debt principle falling due this year.
