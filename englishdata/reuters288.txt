TAIWAN CENTRAL BANK ISSUES CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT
The Central Bank issued 2.14 billion Taiwan dlrs of certificates of deposit (CD), bringing the total so far this year to 86.21 billion, a bank official told Reuters.     The new CD have maturities of six months and one and two years and bear interest rates ranging from 3.9 pct to 5.15 pct.     The issues are aimed at curbing the growth of M-1B money supply, which is the result of large foreign exchange reserves, the official said.
