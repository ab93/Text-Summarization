AMERICAN MOTORS <AMO> BREAKS OFF TALKS ON PLANT
American Motors Corp said that it broke off talks aimed at extending the life of its only U.S. car assembly plant after the union rejected its final proposal for wage concessions.     Negotiations, which continued past a midnight Friday deadline, ended Saturday after United Auto Workers negotiators voted to reject the unspecified concessions, an AMC spokesman said by telephone from Milwaukee, site of the talks.     Without a new agreement containing lower labor costs, AMC said it would phase out vehicle production at the complex in Kenosha, Wisconsin, by 1989.
