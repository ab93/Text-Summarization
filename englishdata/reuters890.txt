TAIWAN REJECTS TEXTILE MAKER PLEA ON EXCHANGE RATE
Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said.     He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.     The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level.     The federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall.     It said the Taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the South Korean won climbed only four pct. The Singapore and Hong Kong dollars remained stable against the U.S. Unit in that period, it said.     Many local bankers and economists predict Taiwan's dollar will rise to between 32 and 33 per U.S. Dollar by year-end.     Chang was quoted as saying this would depend on Taiwan's ability to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. This year.     The surplus widened to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1986 from 10.2 billion in 1985, official figures show.     Taiwan's textile exports fell by almost four pct in January to 562 mln U.S. Dlrs from 583 mln in January 1986, the same figures show.     Textiles are Taiwan's second-largest export earner, after electrical and electronic products.     Textile exports surged to 7.8 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 6.2 billion in 1985. Exports to the U.S. Last year were worth 2.8 billion U.S. Dlrs.
