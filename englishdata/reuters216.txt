JAPAN MARCH BOND COUPON SEEN UNCHANGED AT FIVE PCT
The Finance Ministry has proposed informally to its bond underwriting syndicate that the coupon on the January 10-year government bond remain unchanged from February at five pct, underwriting sources said.     They said the ministry wants a 0.50 yen raise in issue price from February to 99.50 to yield a record low 5.075 pct.     The 5.151 pct February bond issue yield was itself a record low. The proposed issue volume is 475 billion yen against the 600 billion in February.     The underwriting syndicate is likely to accept the proposed terms immediately, the sources said.
