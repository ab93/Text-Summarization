UAL <UAL> UNIT ATTACKED ON MINORITY HIRING
UAL Inc's United Airlines was accused in a congressional hearing today of locking blacks out of key jobs, but the company said it had made tremendous progress in minority hiring.     The issue was aired during a hearing of a House Government Operations subcommittee whose chairman, Rep. Cardiss Collins, called the treatment of minorities by the country's largest airline "pathetic."     "It strikes me odd," said the Illinois Democrat, "that the number of white women pilots is more than double that of black pilots, and that white women are more fairly represented in upper management."     United has been under a court order since 1976 to increase its minority employment.     David Pringle, United's senior vice president for human resources, said "We take a very aggressive approach to minority hiring and have made tremendous progress ... we will continue to pursue even wider goals."
