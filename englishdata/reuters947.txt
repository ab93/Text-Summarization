AUSTRALIAN POLICE ARREST FORMER WESTPAC CLERK
Australian police said they charged a former currency clerk of Westpac Banking Corp <WSTP.S> with misappropriating 8,300 dlrs in July in an alleged foreign-exchange fraud.     A spokeswoman for the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) said the arrest was part of its investigation stemming from complaints from Westpac and <Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd>.     CAC and Westpac officials said they were working out how much money was involved, but said press reports it was as much as five mln dlrs were probably exaggerated.
