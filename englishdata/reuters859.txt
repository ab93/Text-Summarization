CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING DOWN THREE PCT IN JAN
Contracting for future construction work declined by three pct in January to an annualized rate of 236.1 billion dlrs, a report on the industry said.     The report by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co said a 10 pct reversal of nonbuilding construction was largely responsible for the month's setback from December's higher level.     Residential building eased three pct in January, while contracts for commercial, industrial and institutional buildings rebounded slightly, according to the report.     Nonbuilding construction, which soared to an annualized rate of 47.8 billion dlrs in December when last year's only major electric power plant was started, fell back 10 pct to 43.1 billion.     Dodge said contracting for highway and bridge construction advanced five pct in January. However, available funding for 1987 construction could dry up if Congress fails to act after the Federal highway program runs out of carryover spending authority.     Nonresidential buildings edged up one pct in January to an annualized rate of 77.6 billion. Contracting for institutional structures, such as schools and health facilities, was the reason for the gain, the report said.     Residential building was valued at 115.4 billion dlrs in January, a decrease of three pct from December's seasonally adjusted rate, the report stated. However, demand will be strong for single-family units supported by falling mortgage rates, but multi-family buildings will not be in high demand as a result of the tax reform, according to the report.
