NATIONAL BANK ISSUES MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES
<National Bank of Canada> said it is issuing 25 mln dlrs worth of mortgage-backed securities recognized by the federal government's Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.     The bank said the issue is divided into two pools--one bearing annual interest of 8-3/4 pct and the other 8-5/8 pct, with interest calculated semi-annually and paid monthly.     It said the securities are available in denominations of 5,000 dlrs for a term of slightly less than five years.     Underwriters are (Levesque, Beaubien Inc), and (McLeod Young Weir Ltd).     National Bank said the issue is part of a program by Canada Mortgage and Housing, introduced late last year, which provides investors with high quality securities similar to government bonds but with a higher rate of return.
