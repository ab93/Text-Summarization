LEBANESE PRESIDENT AGREES NEW PEACE MOVES
Lebanese President Amin Gemayel has agreed to three key points in a new Syrian-brokered plan aimed at ending civil war in Lebanon, official sources said.     They said the Maronite Christian leader has agreed to give up Cabinet voting rights, to ensure that the Prime Minister is elected by parliament and to the abolition in principle of Lebanon's current power-sharing system.     Gemayel had agreed to the proposals in two months of indirect negotiations with Syrian leaders, the sources said
