FEBRUARY U.S. PURCHASING MANAGER INDEX FALLS
The U.S. Economy continued to expand in February but at a slower pace than in January, which saw a spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) said in a report.     The Association's composite survey index dropped to 51.9 pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator was over 50 pct.     A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy.     The  NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February.     But production remained vigorous, with more than three times as many members reporting it better rather than worse.     Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually resumed production.     The same number of members reported inventories were higher as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984.     For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.     Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee, said: "The economy continued to expand in February, but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for a respectable first quarter."     The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.
