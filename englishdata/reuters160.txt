TORCHMARK <TMK> SELLS SINKING FUND DEBENTURES
Torchmark Corp is raising 200 mln dlrs through an offering of sinking fund debentures due 2017 yielding 8.65 pct, said lead manager First Boston Corp.     The debentures have an 8-5/8 pct coupon and were priced at 99.73 to yield 100 basis points over the off-the-run 9-1/4 pct Treasury bonds of 2016.     Non-refundable for 10 years, the issue is rated A-2 by Moody's and AA by Standard and Poor's.     A sinking fund starts in 1998 to retire 76 pct of the debentures by maturity, giving them an estimated maximum life of 22.4 years. Merrill Lynch co-managed the deal.
