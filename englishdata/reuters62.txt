CANADA'S WILSON SEEKS TEMPORARY BORROWING
Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said he will use temporary authority under the Financial Administration act to borrow an additional 600 mln dlrs in next Thursday's treasury bill auction.     In a statement, Wilson said the action would permit the government to proceed with its debt program during a period when there was not sufficient borrowing authority, which is granted by Parliament, to cover the government's needs.     Ottawa announced previously it was seeking Parliamentary approval for the additional authority to cover the financing of an increase in the government's foreign reserves.
