AQUINO ANNOUNCES LAND REFORM PLANS
President Corazon Aquino announced government plans to devote to land reform an estimated 24 billion pesos (about one billion U.S. Dlrs) raised from the sale of failed businesses taken over by the government.     Aquino said she was willing to have her family's sugar estate broken up in compliance with Philippine land reform programmes but hinted it would not be offered voluntarily.     "Whatever laws will be enacted, I say that nobody is above the law and that includes me. My brothers and sisters are Filipino citizens ... We will abide by whatever laws are enacted as far as sugar land is concerned," she told reporters.     A committee was now formulating guidelines for the plan, including the question of whether land operated by multinational companies should also be covered, she added.     Agrarian Reform Secretary Heherson Alvarez said recently the government planned to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished farmworkers under a revised land reform programme.     The plan, requiring about 1.7 billion dlrs, now also covers sugar and coconut areas, apart from rice and corn lands, he said. It was expected to benefit about three mln landless peasants, he added.     Land reform pressure groups have called on Aquino to break up her family's 6,000-hectare sugar estate to demonstrate her sincerity on the issue political analysts have called one of the most pressing problems facing the Philippines.     It was not known whether government would wait for the Congress to convene by mid-year to formalise the programme or have Aquino carry it out through an executive order.     Under the plan, government will purchase land mainly from landowners with holdings over seven hectares. It will include vacant and untenanted farmland as well as 50,000 hectares seized from former associates of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos.
