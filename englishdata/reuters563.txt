PACIFIC WESTERN FUSES MANAGEMENT WITH CP AIR
<Pacific Western Airlines Corp> said it integrated the senior management of Pacific Western and recently acquired Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd in preparation for the companies' merger this summer.     Pacific Western said it appointed president and chief executive Rhys Eaton as chairman and chief executive in the new management structure, and Murray Sigler as president. Sigler was previously president of Pacific Western's airline unit, Pacific Western Airlines Ltd.     Pacific Western acquired Canadian Pacific Air Lines for 300 mln dlrs last December from Canadian Pacific Ltd <CP>.     Canadian Pacific Air Lines said president and chief executive Donald Carty and four senior vice-presidents resigned last week. Carty said in a company memorandum that he accepted another senior post in commercial aviation and that some of the vice-presidents were taking early retirment and others were resigning for personal reasons.     Pacific Western said the new management structure "will facilitate our objective of proceeding quickly to successfully position ourselves in the marketplace as a single airline network beginning this summer."
