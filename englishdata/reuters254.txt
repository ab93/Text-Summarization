SHULTZ LIKELY TO VISIT MOSCOW SOON
U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz is likely to visit Moscow soon for talks following new Soviet arms control proposals, U.S. Officials said.     The officials told Reuters no decision had been reached on when the trip might take place, but it was likely to be within a month.     Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev proposed on Saturday that talks on medium range missiles be separated from other arms issues.     Schultz is currently visiting Peking.
