Judge Richard Niehaus of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court ordered Warner jailed in lieu of 3.5 mln dlrs bond. He set a 1.5 mln dlr bond for Bongard and 25,000 dlr bond for Schiebel pending the appearance of the trio for sentencing March 30.     Lawrence Kane, special prosecutor, said that Warner and Bongard could receive a maximum of 15 years in prison. He said that Schiebel could receive a maximum of 5 to 6 years on his convictions.     All three were accused in the draining of 144 mln dlrs of Home State funds through investments with ESM Government Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which went bankrupt and triggered the collapse of Home State.     On March 5, 1985, Ohio Governor Richard Celeste closed all of the state's privately-insured savings and loan companies and they remained closed until they could obtain federal deposit insurance or merge with other companies which had federal deposit insurance.
