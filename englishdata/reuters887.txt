JAPANESE DEMAND FOR U.K. GILTS SEEN RISING
Japanese investor interest in British gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and on calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said.     Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said.     Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said.     On the other hand, major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year, traders said.     These investors, who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a British securities house said.     The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year.     Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said.     "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds, suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki.     She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct, against 9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London.
