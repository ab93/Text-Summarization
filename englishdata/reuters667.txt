GULF ARAB OIL MEETING ENDS
Deputy oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) ended a meeting here after discussing co-ordination and co-operation in the oil field, the Bahrain-based Gulf News Agency (GNA) said.     The deputy ministers, who declined to talk to reporters on the outcome of the 90 minute formal session, later concluded a round of informal talks.     The GCC groups four OPEC members -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates --  and non-OPEC nations Bahrain and Oman.     Before the formal session had begun, chairman Yousef Shirawi, Bahrain's Development and Industry Minister, told reporters the gathering was a follow-up to talks held last Sunday in Qatar at full ministerial level.     GNA gave no details on the outcome of today's talks.     It said only, "The deputy ministers discussed current developments in the oil market, particularly those relating to production and prices."     The meeting in Qatar had reaffirmed the six Gulf Arab countries' commitment to OPEC's pricing and production accord forged in December last year.     It also discussed ways of marketing crude oil on behalf of those GCC states encountering resistance to official OPEC prices.     Oil industry sources have said Qatar has faced particular difficulty in selling its full quota of production.
