MANILA SAID TO OFFER DEBT BONDS TO BANKS
The Philippines will offer commercial bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness instead of cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.     Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters Saturday that the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.     He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing."     Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the country's 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.     It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price.     It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no payment of any kind is made until the bond matures.     It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.     The peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the Philippines' debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London interbank offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.     "(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative," Ongpin said. "Our representatives have gone to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World) Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has generally been positively received."     "We don't believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side," Ongpin said. "We have run this alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government regulators indicated that there will be a problem."
