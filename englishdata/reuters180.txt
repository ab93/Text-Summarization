U.S. TREASURY PART OF ARGENTINE BRIDGE LOAN
The U.S. Treasury said it was willing to participate with several other industrial countries in providing a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to Argentina.     The Treasury announcecement did not name the other countries nor the amount of financing the United States was willing to supply.     Argentina announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesday night and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans and other financing.     "Our willingness to participate in this multilateral short-term financing indicates our support for Argentina's economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viable balance of payments position," the Treassury statement said.     In announcing a four-month wage and price freeze, Argentine officials said the country needed "a more serene climate" to carry out structural changes in the economy.     But Argentina did not suspend interest payments on its foreign debts, as neighboring Brazil did last week.     The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing for Argentina would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.     The one-page statement noted the International Monetary Fund expressed confidence in Argentina's economic policies and prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for it on February 18.     "Argentina is expected to qualify for IMF balance-of-payments financing which would enable Argentina to repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation of its economic program," the statement said.     The latest Argentine action marked the second time in less than two years its government has used a wage and price freeze to restrain inflation.     The debt talks in New York are being headed by Argentine Finance Minister Mario Brodersohn and are expected to last for several days.     Along with new financing, Argentina reportedly wants lower interest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreign debt and elimination of foreign banks' control over how some of the money is loaned in Argentina.
