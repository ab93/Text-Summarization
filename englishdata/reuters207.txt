JAPAN TO TRY TO OPEN MARKET TO U.S. CAR PARTS
Japan has pledged to try to increase its purchase of U.S. car parts and also to exchange data to monitor the purchases, the Commerce Department said.     U.S. negotiators opened talks last August with Japanese officials to try to force open the Japanese market to American-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated five billion dlr deficit in car parts trade.     Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of U.S.-made parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts for parts purchases, a Commerce department official said.     He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to try to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders.     The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that "statistics support the perception in the United States that American auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the inner circles of Japan's auto companies and their traditional suppliers."     It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost five billion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985, U.S. firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market.
