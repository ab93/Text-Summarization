ANNUAL MAILING TO DELINQUENT FARMERS -- USDA
The Farmers Home Admininstration (FmHA) is undertaking its annual mailing of notices to delinquent farm borrowers, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     It said about 26,400 FmHA farm borrowers were delinquent on December 31, 1986, and will be sent letters by early March. They should get in touch with the FmHA county office as soon as possible to make an appointment to discuss the account, it said.     The letter requests the borrower choose one or more servicing options listed on an accompanying form and return the form within 30 days, the department said.
