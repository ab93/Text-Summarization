FORMER BROKER, INVESTOR SENTENCED FOR TRADING
A former stock broker and an investor who pleaded guilty last June to insider trading as a participant in the scheme that involved lawyer Michael David were sentenced by the Manhattan federal court today.     Morton Shapiro, who was employed as a broker at Moseley Hallgarten Stabrook and Weeden Inc, drew a two month jail sentence and a 25,000 dlr fine.     Daniel J. Silverman, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud, was sentenced to three years probation, a 25,000 dlr fine, and ordered to provide 250 hours of community service.     As a result of trading on information supplied by David, while he was at the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, the defendants gained about 160,000 dlrs in their insider trading scheme, according to U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.     The prosecutor also said Shapiro attempted to conceal his unlawful trading by lying in testimony before the Securities and Exchange Commission.
